    A coordinate represents a square on the board, it is a pair of integers (x,y).
    The board is 0-indexed, where (_,0) is the top row of the board, and (0,_) is
    the left-most column.
    The state of the board has a list of coordinates (of black and red pieces).

    A move is essentially a list of coordinates, tracing out the path travelled
    by a piece, where you keep track of whether or not the piece is a Pawn or King
    using the PorK datatype.
    The list is "in the right order", e.g. [firstSquare, secondSquare, ...]
